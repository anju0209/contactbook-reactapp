## Reflection
This was a project built during 3rd year of Engineering college as a personal project. The Project goal was to use ```ReactJs``` technology to create a react app to store a contact details in a ```Realtime Database```.

One of the main challenge I ran into was Database and Storage, here I have used Firebase ```RealeTime Databse``` and ```Storage```
